[ASUMA](https://jacksummerfield1.github.io/asuma-project-1/index.html) is designed as a database of updated information including the development of artificial intelligence. Its goal is to showcase the progression of AI from its early stages to its current status and track the rate at which it improves and the reasoning behind it. As it encompasses alot of information, a minimal aesthetic has been maintained to allow the important factors to be highlighted.

### Visual Design

#### Wireframes

#### Fonts

* The primary font, Architype Ballmer was chosen because its clean, modern design reflects the cutting-edge nature of AI technology, creating a visually appealing and professional appoearance for the website. It is also sans-serif, making it very easibly legible throughout different color schemes.

* The secondary font, Pattanakarn was chosen because its unique and stylised letterforms can help the website stand out, conveying a sense of innovation often associated with AI development.

#### Icons

* Icons are taken from the [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) Icon library and are utilised as classes in the <i> tag.
* As they are used as classes, they can easily be styled using other classes or IDs.
* Icons are used for the social media icons in the footer and the dropdown menu for mobile users.

#### Colors

![Color Palette](assets/images/color-pallette.png)

* I wanted the site to maintain a minimal aesthetic, colors are very basic and clean and are associated with AI, people tend to think of blue when it comes to technology, hence the palette.

* Text is primarily written in white to contrast on the bold color backgrounds.

#### Animations

* The site consists of a small variety of animations to provide a sense of activity when arriving on specific pages.

* The uses page consists of 3D flipcard animations to allow some user interactivity with the site.

* The dev page consists of a timeline that moves down the page on load, followed by the images of each development fading in in 1s intervals.
